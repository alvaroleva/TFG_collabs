In this first phase, all the algorithms developed to pass from the initial 24h ECG signal (ISHNE format) to the final table containing the 12-lead ECG biomarkers are described.

> The open-source software [ECG-kit](http://marianux.github.io/ecg-kit/) is used.

## Reading and splitting the 24h signal

In this first script ``m01_ishne2segments_3min.m``, the original 24h Holter recordings in *ISHNE* format are readed using ``.read_signal`` from *ECG-kit*. This method alows to delimit the interval to read. In this case, sliding windows of 3-min are defined for the subsequent step of signal averaging. 

Additionally, the signal is converted from ADC units to microvolts using the ``.gain``, extracted from the original ISHNE header. Furthermore, the baseline (``.adczero``) is removed. 

Finally, the algorithm iterates through all the *BH subjects* saving their 24h ECG signal in 3-min segments. Output signals include all 12-leads.

## Signal averaging
    
Once the 24h ECG signal is segmented in 3-min intervals, signal averaging is applied to each segment aiming to obtain a set of average beats with reduced noise. In our case the implemented algorithm can be found in ``m02_SignalAveraging.m``. In our approach,  ensemble averaging is complemented with shift correction and rejection conditions to avoid considering abnormally misaligned beats in the ensemble. The following "flow-chart-like" scheme describes how the algotithm works. Notice that the implemented algorithm is based on 5 nested for-loops (blue), two quality control conditions derived from Threshold 1 and Threshold 2 (yellow), the generation of 3 auxiliar files (purple) and a set of processes and operations (white boxes).

**NOTE:** Only the files derived from the **accepted** average beats are saved for further processing. The rest are deleted.
